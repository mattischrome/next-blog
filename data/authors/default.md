Matthew Dorey is a health economist in the Public Health and Social Research Unit at West Sussex County Council. His research interests include the valuation of public health interventions, classifying tangible and non-tangible economic outcomes for health interventions, and the communication of health information using novel technology platforms. 

He has a PhD in Mathematical Biology from the University of Bath in the UK. He also has degrees in health economics from the University of Surrey and a masters degree in Networks and Data Science from the University of York. His PhD thesis was about the spread of diseases on social networks. 

He began his career at the Health Protection Agency, an arm of the UK government charged with protecting the nation's health and advancing the cause of public health. This later became known as Public Health England and the same functions are now carried out by two entities: the UK Health Security Authority and the Office of Health Inequalities and Disparities. Between 2008 and 2013, Matthew was the mathematical modeller for the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP).
