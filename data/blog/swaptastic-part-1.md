Envelopes containing swaps that have arrived in the post in recent days. It is nice to get letters from all over the country, even if they do just contain a selection of [panini stickers](/euro-2016-panini-stickers/). As I mentioned in a previous post, I have used [the sticker swapping website](http://www.stickerswapping.com) to share my swaps with people all over the UK. I have sent swaps off to London, Bristol, Cornwall, Lancashire, Wales, and Gloucester. You'll also be happy to know that I got my hands on an Aleksei Berezutski. Only 52 left to go!
