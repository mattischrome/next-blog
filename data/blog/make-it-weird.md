Today I listened to 'Cloudbusting' by Kate Bush for the first time in a while. What a gloriously strange song it is. Best of all, it's one of those songs that obscures what it is really about. It's not a song about a change in the weather, but about [Wilhelm Reich][1], the [orgone][2] accumulator, [fluorescent yo-yos][3], and a son (rather than a *sun*) coming out.  

'Cloudbusting' is from 'Hounds of Love', Kate's 'comeback' album following the commercial failure of ['The Dreaming'][4], an album I wrote about in my [understated classics series][5]. It features four UK top 10 singles and some of her best work.

Does 'The Hounds of Love' in any way represent a compromise in artistic integrity compared to 'The Dreaming'? Nope. The entirety of  side two is given over to a song suite about having a bad dream, 'Cloudbusting' is probably *still* the weirdest song ever to reach the top of the charts, 'Running Up That Hill' deftly delivers a feminist message years ahead of time, and  the title track compares the pursuit of love to a fox hunt.

In fact, I'd argue that 'Hounds of Love' is more odd and uncompromising than 'The Dreaming'. If in doubt, make it weirder.
