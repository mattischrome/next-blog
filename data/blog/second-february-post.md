summary: Hmmm it seems as though the ffi gem as installed by bundler is not compatible
  with a Mac that has an M1 chip. This limits my ability to preview blog posts locally.
  I might have to swap to a more modern static site generator (which is probably easier
  than working out what ffi actually does) - seems like a good February project!

Hmmm it seems as though the `ffi` gem as installed by bundler is not compatible with a Mac that has an M1 chip. This limits my ability to preview blog posts locally.
