summary: '

  "I was twenty-one at the time, about to turn twenty-two. No prospect of graduating
  soon, and yet no reason to quit school. Caught in the most curiously depressing
  circumstances. For months I’d been stuck, unable to take one step in any new direction.
  The world kept moving on; I alone was at a standstill. In the autumn, everything
  took a desolate cast, the colors swiftly fading before my eyes. The sunlight, the
  smell of the grass, the faintest patter of rain, everything got on my nerves. How
  many times did I dream of catching a train at night?"
