summary: The shiny app embedded below allows you to explore the number of packets
  you need to complete the Panini sticker album for this summer's Euro tournament.
  This builds on the results I presented in an earlier post and allows you to explore
  how many fewer packets you need to buy when you have more friends to swap with.
  You can also vary the number of runs performed because the model runs considerably
  slower with more swappers involved.

The shiny app embedded below allows you to explore the number of packets you need to complete the Panini sticker album for this summer's Euro tournament. This builds on the results I presented in an [earlier post](link to earlier post) and allows you to explore how many fewer packets you need to buy when you have more friends to swap with. You can also vary the number of runs performed because the model runs considerably slower with more swappers involved.

Note that on some mobile devices you may get a better experience if you visit the shinyapps page for the app: [mattischrome.shinyapps.io/StickerSwaps](https://mattischrome.shinyapps.io/StickerSwaps).

Good luck with your collections! Use the swapping websites and you will have a complete album in no time!
