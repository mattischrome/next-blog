summary: I found "Learn X in Y minutes" (www.learnxinyminutes.com) while researching
  the programming languages needed for a new project. The site aims to help people
  who know at least one programming language to learn others by proving a quick run
  through of the main language features. It's not quite enough to get you up and running.
  After all, having sample code doesn't get you the compiler. However, it's a nice
  start that shows you how similar (and different) language X is compared to the one(s)
  you already know.
