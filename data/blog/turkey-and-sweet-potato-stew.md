---

Here's a recipe to use up your turkey leftovers after Christmas.

You will need a slow cooker or an oven-proof cooking dish.

## Ingredients
* About four portions of cold turkey, torn into bite-sized pieces
* 1 sweet potato, chopped into small slivers
* 1 carrot, chopped into small slivers
* 1 onion, diced
* 2 cloves of garlic, diced
* 2 tsp mixed herbs
* 2 tsp smoked paprika
* 20g butter
* 50g diced chorizo
* 1 chicken stock cube mixed in about 700ml water (see method)

## Method
1. Melt the butter and fry the onions on a medium heat until golden.
2. Add the garlic and fry this mixture for a further thirty seconds.
3. Add the diced chorizo and continue to fry, adding a little stock and turning down the heat if things get a little too sticky.
4. Fold in the cold turkey and mix into the onions, garlic and chorizo.
5. Add half of the stock and bring to the boil.
6. Add the carrots, the sweet potato and the remainder of the stock.
7. Transfer to a slow cooker or the oven proof dish. If you're using a slow cooker, you need to make sure liquid covers the contents of the pot.
8. Use the default high setting of your slow cooker, or cook in the oven at 160C for about two hours.
9. Check on the pot when about 30 minutes of cooking time remains. If you need to thicken the mixture, stir about a tablespoon of cornflour into about 20ml of water and then add this to the pot, stirring it in well.
10. Serve with rice and a green vegetable.
