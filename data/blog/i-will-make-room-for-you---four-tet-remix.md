In a perfect confluence of [last month's album digest](album-digest-october-2011), here's an excellent Four Tet remix of Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith's "I Will Make Room For You" from her album "The Kid". I've put it into a playlist with "Lush" from Four Tet's "New Energy" album and the original version of "I Will Make Room For You."
